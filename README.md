# Python-Web-Scraping

I. Objective:

Use Python to get information on one product, which was sold on Amazon. After that, update the price day by day to analyze which day we should buy the product with the best deal. Using this method I can track and decide when I will buy the product and give useful information not spending too much effort to get it by myself daily.

II. Process:

1. Import and connect to the website.
